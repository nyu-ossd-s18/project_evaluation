## Summary assesment
How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?

Relatively friendly for beginners; there are quite a few issues that are labeled either "novice" or "medium" in difficulty.  There are plenty of active users that seem to be open to discussing new issues, and their website outlines how to contribute to the project in good detail.

Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?

Yes: when certain users were having trouble with even their machines with the software, the maintainers responded very kindly, and helped people to work out their own personal problems.  In other issues, they discuss and label issues based on what they believe should be done.


Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?

They seem to be friendly enough; in issues marked invalid and closed, when users were complaining of problems that were either rookie mistakes or their own faults, the users were quick to jump in and help them out.  Their IRC is dead, but the discussions on GitHub seem friendly.


Do pull requests get reviewed?

Yes: when one is not reviewed, they leave up a label of "status: needs review", and otherwise seem to go through all of the pull requests properly.

Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

Yes, when a good contribution is made, the maintainers are quick to thank them for their work.
