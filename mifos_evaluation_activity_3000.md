## Finding info about contributing on the website. 

In the following section you should only enter the information that you 
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers. 

__Project website:__

http://mifos.org/

__What is the purpose of the project:__

Only open platform for financial inclusion, we provide affordable, adaptable and accessible solutions for any segment of the market, new and small financial institutions can easily start with our community app in a hosted environment, medium and large institutions that are evolving into full-service providers of financial inclusion can use our global network of IT partners to configure a Mifos X solution, and innovators can build and scale entirely new solutions on our API-driven platform.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__

So it was relatively okay finding information on how to contribute. We went to the website, clocked on Resources / Documentation / Technical Documentation / Getting Started for Developers and there is where they have listed information on how to contribute to the project with nore detail. 


__Contributing instructions:__ 

https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/MDZ/pages/92012609/How+to+contribute


__URL for the code repository:__

https://github.com/openMF/mifosx
So we found this link in the documentation, but this repo is now deprecated and it links us to a project called Apache Finteract which seems to be the new direction in which they're moving towards. 

Apache Finteract: https://github.com/apache/fineract

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__

https://github.com/openMF/mifosx/issues 

This issue link is still under the Mifos repo so it does make it a little confusing since the new project is under Apache Finteract. 

__Mailing list:__

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mifos/lists/mifos-developer

__Chat channel:__
Glitter Channel: https://gitter.im/openMF/mifos
Mifos Connect: https://gitter.im/openMF/mifos

## Summary assesment
How friendly is this project for beginner contributors? 
It is not that friendly for beginner contributers because it is a little confusing to find information on contributing and it doesn't seem to have a strong community that helps each other. It looks like it had busier phases but it seems like it has kind of slowed down at this point. 


Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Maintainers do not respond that much to questions that other people have. 


Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?
People are quite friendly on the channel anbd thee is stuff from quite recently. The chat might be a better communication place to go for help regarding the project. Generally they are quite friendly, we just noticed that they might not be keeping track of them as much. 


Do pull requests get reviewed?
Some pull requests get reviewed but they dont't really keep track of all of it. 



Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
They don't really thank people openly for their contributions.
